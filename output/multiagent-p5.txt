🔹 Task Setup Agent: To create an optimized task schedule aligned with the given constraints, the tasks should be arranged as follows:

1. **Clothes Pickup**: Schedule this task before 2:00 PM. It's important to complete this task early to ensure there is enough time for any unforeseen delays and to have the clothes ready for the photo session.

2. **Gift Collection**: Schedule this task after 12:00 PM. This allows flexibility to complete it after the clothes pickup and before the photo session, ensuring all tasks are completed efficiently.

3. **Photo Session**: Schedule this task at 3:00 PM as specified. This is a fixed time and should be adhered to precisely.

**Optimized Task Schedule:**

- 11:00 AM - 1:30 PM: Clothes Pickup
- 1:30 PM - 2:30 PM: Gift Collection
- 3:00 PM: Photo Session

This schedule ensures all tasks are completed within their respective time constraints and allows for a smooth flow of activities leading up to the photo session.
🔹 Resource Management Agent: Optimized 5 vehicle allocation and friend welcome ensuring timely arrivals. - Onecar (5-seater) with Pat, available after he is Boston - Local friend Chris (5-seater) available after 1:30 PM at 𝑊
🔹 Constraint Validation Agent: To ensure that all tasks are completed within the specified operating hours and vehicle constraints, we need to create a schedule that adheres to the following conditions:

1. **Operating Hours:**
   - All tasks must be completed before 3:00 PM.
   - The gift store opens at 12:00 PM.
   - The tailor closes at 2:00 PM.

2. **Vehicle Constraints:**
   - Two cars are available to accommodate all transport needs.

**Validated Schedule:**

- **Task 1: Visit Tailor**
  - **Start Time:** 10:00 AM
  - **End Time:** 11:00 AM
  - **Notes:** Ensure this task is completed before the tailor closes at 2:00 PM.

- **Task 2: Visit Gift Store**
  - **Start Time:** 12:00 PM
  - **End Time:** 1:00 PM
  - **Notes:** This task must start no earlier than 12:00 PM when the gift store opens.

- **Task 3: Photo Session**
  - **Start Time:** 1:30 PM
  - **End Time:** 2:30 PM
  - **Notes:** Ensure this task is completed before 3:00 PM.

**Vehicle Allocation:**

- **Car 1:**
  - Transport for Task 1 (Visit Tailor) and Task 3 (Photo Session).

- **Car 2:**
  - Transport for Task 2 (Visit Gift Store).

This schedule ensures that all tasks are completed within the operating hours, and the two cars are used efficiently to accommodate all transport needs without any conflicts.
