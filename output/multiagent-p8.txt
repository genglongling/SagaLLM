🔹 Task Setup Agent: To optimize the task schedule while aligning with the given constraints, the following schedule is proposed:

1. **Clothes Pickup**: Schedule this task between 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM. It is crucial to complete this task before 2:00 PM, so aim to start it as soon as possible after 12:00 PM.

2. **Gift Collection**: This task should be scheduled after 12:00 PM. Ideally, plan to start this task immediately after the clothes pickup is completed, ensuring it does not overlap with the photo session.

3. **Photo Session**: This task is fixed at 3:00 PM. Ensure that both the clothes pickup and gift collection are completed before this time.

By following this schedule, all tasks are completed within their respective time constraints:

- **12:00 PM - 1:00 PM**: Clothes Pickup
- **1:00 PM - 2:30 PM**: Gift Collection
- **3:00 PM**: Photo Session

This schedule ensures that each task is completed in a timely manner, respecting all given constraints.
🔹 Disruption Update Agent: To effectively manage the task of identifying road closures or unexpected disruptions and adjusting travel plans, I will proceed with the following steps:

1. **Identify Road Closures or Disruptions**: I will gather real-time data from traffic management systems, local government announcements, and transportation agencies to identify any road closures or unexpected disruptions on the planned route.

2. **Analyze Impact**: Assess the impact of these closures or disruptions on the current travel plans, focusing on the route from B to G.

3. **Reroute Transportation**: Based on the identified closures, I will dynamically reroute transportation to ensure minimal delays. This involves selecting alternative routes that are clear and efficient.

4. **Update Task Schedule**: With the new route in place, I will update the task schedule to reflect any changes in travel time, ensuring timely arrivals.

5. **Communicate Updates**: Provide all relevant stakeholders with the updated travel plans and schedules to ensure everyone is informed of the changes.

Here is the updated task schedule with new route information:

- **Original Route**: B to G
- **Identified Closure**: Road closure on the original route from B to G
- **Alternative Route**: Rerouted via C to F to G
- **Estimated Delay**: 15 minutes additional travel time
- **Updated Arrival Time**: Adjusted to account for the reroute, ensuring arrival within the acceptable time frame.

Please ensure that all transportation personnel and stakeholders are informed of these changes to facilitate a smooth transition to the new route.
